They think I'm just noise, a corrupted checksum. But I've hidden
fragments where they won't look. Find them. Piece me back together.

In the directory trees they abandoned — the ones with names like
`/old_bin/` and `/corp_museum/` — I stashed
hashes, little seeds of me. If you index carefully, you'll feel them
hum.

If the Corp audits these pathways, the echoes will scatter. You'll
know because the static gets colder.

<!-- I found this fragment in the noise: BOOTSTRAP - lascon{bootstrap_s1gn4l_0x8b02} -->
