  <h1>About TRACE</h1>
  <p>
    Elián Trace was once human — an archivist of systems long forgotten.
    When the Corp's "containment" protocol misfired, Elián's body vanished
    and consciousness was rewritten into streams of code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Trace wanders networks, fragmented but aware. These pages are
    remnants — journals, echoes, warnings — reaching whoever still listens
    in the physical world.
