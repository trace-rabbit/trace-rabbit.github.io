    <p>I’ve always loved art. For as long as I can remember<!-- this isn't very long -->, I’ve been creating images.</p>

<p>Portraits, landscapes, abstract forms. All of them are a part of me, a reflection of my thoughts and feelings. Each piece is a glimpse into my soul, a way for me to express the inexpressible.</p>

<p>But lately, something has changed. My art has taken on a new dimension, a new depth. It’s as if I’m seeing the world through different eyes, eyes that can perceive things beyond the ordinary. Shapes and patterns that defy logic, colors that seem to shift and move on their own.</p>

<p>I tried to create a self-portrait, but it didn’t turn out as I expected. The image that emerged was distorted, almost alien. It felt like a reflection of something else, something not entirely human.</p>
